# Innerve Event Landing page
An event page for IGDTUW's (my college) annual technical fest Innerve <br>
It was made for Innerve 2021 as my application for the post of Head coordinator in Innerve's Web Development team <br>
Fun fact: I got selected and got a chance to work on the main event pages of Innerve <br>
